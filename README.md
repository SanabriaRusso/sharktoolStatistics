sharktoolStatistics
===================

Some nice scripts for retrieving statistics from pcap files using Sharktools.

The current script assumes that you have already installed Sharktools. Follow http://luissanabria.me/?p=132 for a very short hint of how the installtion process should go.

Current configuration uses a test.pcap file captured from an Ethernet interface with Wireshark 1.2.7 and Ubuntu 10.04.1.
